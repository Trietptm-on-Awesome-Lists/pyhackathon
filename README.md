# CrytoPrimitive Python Weekend Hackathon
* https://redd.it/83d3lz
* https://cryptoprimitive.slack.com/messages

## Purpose
Smart contracts should, in theory, make coordination easier.

Then, with Python's strength in rapid prototyping, we could build as we use them. So as I build a given interface, I could, say, open BP with a few keystrokes, and trust that it might get seen within the dev group and taken care of within minutes.

## Todos
The focus will be on quickly building Python apps that the participants can use via command-line right away. We will begin by interfacing with the already-written contractsÂ [here](https://github.com/cryptoprimitive/contracts): Burnable Payments, BurnChat, and CrowdServe. This should be accomplished at a basic level within the first few hours.

After that, the focus of the hackathon will be on making interaction easier and more fluid via Python command line or simple GUI.
